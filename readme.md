# üßê Project philosophy

> The Well app is a mental health and mindfulness app built on top of the science of positive psychology. The Well app is more than just another meditation or journaling app; it encourages you to enhance and reflect on your day with structured, guided activities.
> 
> There are 5 daily tasks that the Well app asks you to complete each day: record 3 gratitudes, write a journal entry, perform 3 acts of kindness, exercise for 20 minutes, and meditate for 15 minutes.

**Read more about the Well app on [the project homepage](https://projects.colegaw.in/well-app?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=well_app_readme).**
